Day 1 


Angular 

Components ,Pipes ,Services,Directives(*ngFor),Routing,Guards

Componetns : 
1. This is building blocks of Angular application.
2. This is reusable plugin
3. Made of 4 files 
 .html,.css,.ts,.spec.ts
-- App is the default component and head-main component of an application 
-- Component can be injected/plugged inside another component, in a simple way
   <app-bookticket></app-bookticket>
-- In angular ,we use following command to create components 
   Ng generate components bookticket
Command : ng g c bookticket
-- As a good practice, we create a folder -components inside src/app folder and create all the components inside the components folder


--- Comment everything in html 

Ctrl+A
Ctrl +K +C 

Angulr applications  are created in pieces called Components 

We create separate components for every unique functionality 
Eg. 
SearchFligts 
Book 
BookingHistory 
PaymentDetails 
UserProfile

Pipes in Angular : 
Pipes are using in .html file for formatting the data display
Eg : uppercase is a pipe, which will display data in uppercase
     FirstName:string = 'Sonu';(in.ts file)
   <h4>{{FirstName | uppercase }}</h4>

---There are lot of inbuilt pipes in Angular are uppercase, lowercase, titlecase, date, percentage, json, etc.

---- We can also create custom pipe 
      Ng g p pipename (command)
      Ng g p greetuser (example)

   Eg > firstName:string ="sonu"

   Custom Pipe

   1. create a new pipe in the pipes folder
   2. ng g p greeting
   3. go to greeting.pipe.ts file, and observe the file,
        the class implements pipetransform Interface
        and we need transform method to change the format of the data
   4. erase the transform method, and we will write our own 
   transform(value:String){
      return 'Hello'+value;
   }
